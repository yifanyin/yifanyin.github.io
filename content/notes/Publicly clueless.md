I am a person that does not like writing and doesn't write well. Of all the research works my least favorite is writing. So, instead of decisive blog posts I will probably grind on forever, evolving notes are way friendlier to write and come back to.

So here you go. This is the place I'll dump my notes in. And you are welcome to see how clueless I usually am.
