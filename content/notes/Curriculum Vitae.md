# Summary
- Experienced seismologist in multiple fields, including waveform and data analysis, body- and surface-wave tomography, statistical seismology, and earthquake cycle modeling.
- PhD thesis focus on [[notes/prj-tempmatch|connecting seismic sequences with physical observation]] and [[notes/prj-eqsim|numerical models of earthquake ruptures]].
- Demonstrated capabilities in collaborating and communicating with observational seismologist, simulation scientists and statisticians in and across institutes.

# Work Experience

## Research assistant at Academia Sinica
- *September 2010 - January 2016*
- Research assistant with Dr. Frédéric Deschamps working on anisotropy tomography of the North Island, New Zealand and Eastern United States. Duties include dispersion curve fitting, inversion and manuscript writing.
