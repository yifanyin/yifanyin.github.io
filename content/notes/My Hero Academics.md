Self-promotion is something I struggle with for as long as I have memories.  Imagine how bad I usually feel in a conference.  As the end of the PhD approach, the anxiety came back once again. I even [made a website](notes/Making%20a%20github-hosted%20website.md) just because some twitter chatter about the importance of a site for promoting yourself. For a person that does pretty bad at mingling, this is probably the better strategy for self-promotion.

But really, why do we need all these mingling to achieve academic glory? Isn't science supposed to be merit-based? And Isn't every project a group effort? Struggling with the [hero model](https://issues.org/say-goodbye-hero-model-science-elkins-tanton-kavli/) really bothers me.
