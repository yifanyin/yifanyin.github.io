What are built environments from the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment)

# Build the built environment in a less intrusive way

> 穿透式的鋼構壩，在不妨礙生態系運作的情況下，達到避災減災的目的。「降雨將上游的土砂往下游帶，達到補充海岸泥沙，原是自然運作的法則。」許文奕說，而穿透式的壩體，就可讓顆粒較小、沖刷力道相對小的砂石往下游帶。

# Copper mining directly from brine instead of digging it

From [the Economist](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/07/07/people-may-one-day-drill-for-copper-as-they-now-drill-for-oil)

> Copper is an essential part of batteries, motors and charging equipment. Solar and wind installations use more copper than their fossil-fuel counterparts, and electric vehicles contain four times more copper than do cars with combustion engines.

But the way of mining copper in opencast mines destroy environment and preserves, putting green energy at odds with conservation efforts.
