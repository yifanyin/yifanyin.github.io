Welcome to Yifan's personal website that doubled as a digital pile of notes.

I am a seismologist by training, but wandered across different fields of geophysics during my career. I am most fascinated by the way solid earth scientists pick up various signals from the seemingly chaos and turn them into knowledge. My trajectory mostly follow this line in spite the varied methods and models I use to understand the world.

## Professional Interests
I am interested in the interplay of data and models. In seismology, this is especially challenging and fun because of the vast scale of space and time involved. My first love was seismic imaging and inversion that turns discrete phase arrival times into velocity models. Now I deal with earthquake statistics and ways to combine discrete earthquakes, segmented faults and continuous crustal deformation.

### Master and PhD Projects

- [[notes/prj-tempmatch.md|Crustal strain and seismicity]]
- [[notes/prj-eqsim|Seismicity Simulations]]
- 👉 [[notes/EMME23|Updating seismic hazard model in the Middle East]]

### Technical experiences
- Data analyst at the [Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology](https://bats.earth.sinica.edu.tw/) (BATS), Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
    - Routine focal mechanism solutions and bulletins for noticeable loca earthquakes
    - Database and metadata organization
- Assistant researcher at [SinoTech Consultant](https://www.sinotech.org.tw/) on extreme weather events and landslide monitoring.

## Personal Interests
- [[notes/Better built environmemts|Sustainability in built environments]]
- [Hiking](https://yifanyin.github.io/tags/hiking/), best perform in hot and humid jungles, but Alpine pasture with cow poops are not too bad, either.
- [Cooking and coffee](https://yifanyin.github.io/tags/food-and-drink/)
